# EPL ABR Waveform Extractor
This R script searches for EPL Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) files in a folder (the folder may only contain EPL ABR files and analyzed EPL ABR .txt files), extracts the ABR waveform, IDs, and intensities and stores them as a data.table object called 'df' for visualization and analysis. To use, download the R script from [Files](https://github.com/thepyottlab/EPL-ABR-Waveform-Extractor/blob/main/EPL%20ABR%20Waveform%20Extractor.R). Open it in RStudio and replace put the folder path in `'folder <- "put_folder_path_with_epl_files_here"` and run the script.
